# MonkeyJobCodes
 By the [Urban Dictironary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Monkey%20job) a Monkey Job is a repetitive task that requires little or zero thinking. Within this in mind, this set of python codes, Dynamo codes, and/or C# Dynamo Custom Nodes were created.


### Revit Dynamo - Integration
As for now, I have not uploaded the package to Dynamo package manager. Therefore, the current way to use this package inside of Dynamo is to Download this Repository and then import library through file dropdown menu.
Go to the downloaded Repository and import the file:
[...\MonkeyJobNodes\MonkeyJobNodes\bin\Release\MonkeyJobNodes.dll](MonkeyJobNodes\MonkeyJobNodes\bin\Release\MonkeyJobNodes.dll)



### Development
As for now, I develop based on my needs and on available time. However, feel free to develop new codes, suggest ideas. This is a fully open source Repository. Therefore, you are more than welcome to contribute.
Suggestions please send me a message.


### Examples
I am in the process of creating my website, where I will have the examples explained. However, a file with examples is available and there you will find Dynamo scripts examples that uses Monkey Job Nodes.
