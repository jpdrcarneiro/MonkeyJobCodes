# MonkeyJobCodes
By the [Urban Dictironary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Monkey%20job) a Monkey Job is a repetitive task that requires little or zero thinking. Whithin this in mind, this set of codes and/or Dynamo codes were creatred.

### Revit Dynamo - Integration
As for now I have not upload the package to Dynamo package manager. Therefore, the current way to use this in Dynamo is to Download this Repository and then import library through file dropdown menu. 
Go to the dowloaded Repository and import the file:
[...\MonkeyJobNodes\MonkeyJobNodes\bin\Release\MonkeyJobNodes.dll](MonkeyJobNodes\MonkeyJobNodes\bin\Release\MonkeyJobNodes.dll)



### Development
As for now, I develop as my need for new codes go. However, feel free to develop new codes, suggest ideas. This is a fully open source Repository. Therefore, you are more than welcome to contribute.
Suugestions please send me a message.


### Examples
I am in the process of creating my website, where I will have the examples explained. Howevewr, a file with examples is a available and there you will find Dynamo scripts examples that uses Monkey Job Nodes.
